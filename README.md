# IOT_RoomControlSystem
My exam project for the 2020/21 Embedded Software for the IoT course at University of Trento.

It consists in a door alarm that sends a notification to your Telegram account whenever it detects movement. It can also be remotely controlled with a Telegram bot.

A demonstration is available at [this YouTube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PAIBuAd3h1c&t=2s).
